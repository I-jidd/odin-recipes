    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide flat pasta sheets, alternating with rich and savory fillings such as tomato sauce, creamy b√©chamel sauce, cheese (typically mozzarella and Parmesan), and often a meat sauce made with ground beef or Italian sausage. The layers are then baked until the pasta is tender and the cheeses are melted and bubbly, resulting in a hearty and comforting meal.</p>
